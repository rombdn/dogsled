doggysled : quick and dirty game with html5 and box2d
=========

little game I made while playing around with html5 canvas and box2d (http://box2d.org/) using these tutorials http://blog.sethladd.com/search/label/box2d

all the game logic and code is in index.html (see below ;) )

the code is dirty, not robust and not maintenable (i added functionnalities gradually as i learned...) but maybe some parts could serve as real situation exemples of how to use box2d in javascript and how to add graphics in front of box2d.

is used box2dweb : http://code.google.com/p/box2dweb/ 

this version is a port of box2d 2.1 which lacks features like rope joint but I realized it too late.
there are more up to date ports i didn't try like these ones : http://code.google.com/p/box2d-html5/ or https://github.com/kripken/box2d.js

i do not own (all) the graphics

have fun!
