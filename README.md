Dogsled : Quick and dirty game with HTML5 canvas and Box2D
=========

** Refactoring in progress! **

This a little game I made while playing around with HTML5 canvas and Box2D following these tutorials : http://blog.sethladd.com/search/label/box2d

You can play it here : http://www.wajrak.com

This version is a port of box2d 2.1 which lacks features like rope joint. There are more up to date ports i didn't try like these ones : http://code.google.com/p/box2d-html5/ or https://github.com/kripken/box2d.js

I do not own most of the graphics parts.

Have fun!
