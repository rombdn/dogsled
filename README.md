Dogsled
=========

This a little game I made while toying with HTML5 canvas and Box2D (therefore the code is not structured at all).

You can play it here : http://www.wajrak.com

The Box2D library I have used is a port of box2d 2.1 which lacks features like rope joint (realized it too late). There are more up to date ports i didn't try like these ones : http://code.google.com/p/box2d-html5/ or https://github.com/kripken/box2d.js


Have fun!
